###Info###
Logical Operations
Also some examples of logical operators at work. Converting characters from lower case to uppercase and some bit comparisons. 

###Compile & Running###
use `make` to compile a binary,
use `bin/flags` to run the binary, where {operation} is the logical operation you want to perform. Use `echo $?` to check the results.
